# ANT61-Hackathon

my_ideas* brain;

2 major orbit. Geostationary orbit 

TLE helps you with identifying with evetyhing relating to an object in orbit. 

3Gs for map simulation 

Multiple satellites 
Suggesting solutions 

Timelaspse mode where you tracke SME as 3d spheres around the earth. On the left side of UI you can display every active threat to your satilite. You can show every single CME

All satelitles and aestroids should have an ID

Timeline on top where you can scroll forward or back in time showing the movement of your CME and 

Vercel to make the webpage that you can deplot on. You can connect vercel on your github 
Vercel Vo is a LLM for vercel that can make UI and 

satellite.js using the TLE template 

Integrate scaffold to work with satellite.js (to simulate orbit of the satellite) 

TLE will work on debris and satellite but probably wont work for CME 


All liibrires,
All technologies/ frameworks
Where i would host 
All related API 
GIves phases to follow to build this program
